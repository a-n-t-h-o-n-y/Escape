# Escape üï≥Ô∏è

__Terminal Escape Sequence Library__

`Escape` provides support for generating and interpreting terminal escape sequences.
These can be written to the terminal to control cursor movement, text formatting, and
colors. It also includes a `read()` function to produce keyboard input, mouse input, and
window resize events.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <esc/esc.hpp>

using namespace esc;

int main()
{
    std::cout
        << escape(Brush{
                .background = XColor::Cyan,
                .foreground = TColor{0xF02127},
                .traits     = Trait::Italic,
           }) << "Hello"

        << escape(Brush{}) << " üëΩ "

        << escape(
                fg(TColor{0x76F09C}),
                Trait::Bold | Trait::Underline
           ) << "World!"

        << escape(Brush{}) << std::endl;
}
```

based library that uses `Escape` under the hood.

## Features

- **Dynamic Terminal Control**: Generate escape sequences for cursor movement, text formatting, and colors.
- **Event Handling**: Includes a `read()` function to handle keyboard, mouse input, and window resize events, enabling interactive terminal applications.
- **Cross-Terminal Compatibility**: Designed to work across various terminals without relying on a terminfo database.

## Dependencies

- [ICU Library](https://icu.unicode.org/)
    - For Unicode support.
    - Must be installed on your system.
- [zzz Library](https://github.com/a-n-t-h-o-n-y/zzz)
    - Utilities and Tests.
    - CMake fetches this on configure.

## Build Instructions

    git clone https://github.com/a-n-t-h-o-n-y/Escape.git
    mkdir Escape/build && cd Escape/build
    cmake ..
    make escape                                 # Build Library
    make escape.tests.unit                      # Build Unit Tests (Optional)
    make escape.examples.pong                   # Build PONG Game (Optional)

## Example Code

- [tools/termcaps.cpp](./tools/termcaps.cpp)
- [examples/pong.cpp](./examples/pong.cpp)
- [tests/glyph.test.cpp](./tests/glyph.test.cpp)

## TODO

- **Focus Events**: Integrate `TerminalFocusIn` and `TerminalFocusOut` events for focus
tracking. Events are triggered on `CSI I` and `CSI O` input sequences, enabled by Focus
Event Mouse 1004. Dependent on widespread terminal emulator support.
- **BELL Sequences**: Add BELL sequences to adjust alert frequency and duration.

## Current Limitations

- **Incompatible Terminals**: Known issues with `aterm` and `eterm`.
- **Mouse Input Handling**: In Konsole, mouse input is limited to `MouseMode::Drag`.

Feedback and contributions are appreciated. If you encounter any issues or have
suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on our repository.

## Note

Terminal features and support vary significantly across emulators. It's recommended to
test functionality in your target environments.
